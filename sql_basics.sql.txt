Difference between DROP TABLE and TRUNCATE TABLE:
If you want to empty a table but keep its structure, use TRUNCATE TABLE. If you want to remove the table entirely, use DROP TABLE. 
TRUNCATE TABLE: you can't roll back the operation. Once you execute it, the data is gone.
DROP TABLE: The operation can usually be rolled back
